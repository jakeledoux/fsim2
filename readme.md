# fsim2

This project is currently pre-alpha, and though it's technically playable it's not even remotely
entertaining. If you're interested in playing, please check back in a few weeks/months.

However, if you're interested in contributing then now's the perfect time. The game is still
malleable, the codebase is lights, and there are lots of really important decisions still yet
to made. In other words, this is a really fun time to join.
