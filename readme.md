This project is currently pre-alpha, and though it's technically playable it's not even remotely
entertaining. If you're interested in playing, please check back in a few weeks/months.

However, if you're interested in contributing then now's the perfect time. The game is still
malleable, the codebase is lights, and there are lots of really important decisions still yet
to made. In other words, this is a really fun time to join.

Documentation is sparse to non-existent, but now that things are starting to become more
concrete the quality of documentation will go up quite a bit.

More information to follow.
